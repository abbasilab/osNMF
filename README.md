## Use
* Unsupervised identification of principal patterns (PPs) from spatial gene expression and spatial transcriptomics data
* Create of unique spatial ontologies from a search of known anatomical regions
* Stability framework to ensure stability of PPs and ontology
* Interpretabilility via gene reconstructions for each PP

## Requirements

Python 3.9

Python packages: matplotlib, napari, networkx, nrrd, numpy, os, pandas, pickle, sklearn
