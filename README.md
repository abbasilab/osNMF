# DecGene: Unsupervised pattern discovery in spatial gene expression atlas reveals mouse brain regions beyond established ontology

(To update authors and link once paper is posted.)

## Use
* Unsupervised identification of principal patterns (PPs) from spatial gene expression and spatial transcriptomics data
* Stability framework to ensure stability of PPs
* Interpretabilility via gene reconstructions for each PP

## Requirements
Python packages: matplotlib, napari, networkx, nrrd, numpy, os, pandas, pickle, sklearn
