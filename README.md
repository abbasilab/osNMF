# DecGene: Unsupervised pattern discovery in spatial gene expression atlas reveals mouse brain regions beyond established ontology

Note: add authors, abstract, 1-2 figures

## Use
* Unsupervised identification of principal patterns (PPs) from spatial gene expression and spatial transcriptomics data
* Stability framework to ensure stability of PPs
* Interpretabilility via gene reconstructions for each PP
